# This is an h1

## h2

#### h4

this is a paragraph of text, with **bold** and *italic* text in it.

```rust
// this is some rust code
struct Thing {
    a: u8,
    b: String,
    c: Vec<f32>,
}

fn do_thing(t: &Thing) {
    assert!(1 + 1 == 2);
}
```

I'm not super sure how I want to handle images yet, but we'll see what happens
